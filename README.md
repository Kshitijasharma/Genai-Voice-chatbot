https://impetusawsgenaihackathon.devpost.com/?_gl=1*4oonh8*_gcl_au*ODU0MDczODQ0LjE3NDU1ODE5Nzc.*_ga*MzYxNTM4NTg3LjE3NDU1ODE5ODA.*_ga_0YHJK3Y10M*czE3NTEyODMxODQkbzI4JGcwJHQxNzUxMjgzMTg0JGo2MCRsMCRoMA..

Problem Statemet #1 : "Develop an AI-Driven Live Call Insights solution that enables real-time suggestions during live calls by converting speech to text and extracting actionable insights from pre-trained data. The system must support proper data ingestion and preprocessing workflows to handle audio streams effectively. It should deliver real-time processing with low latency to ensure prompt responses and maintain strong contextual understanding of ongoing conversations. An interactive chatbot interface is required to present insights clearly to users. Additionally, the solution must incorporate responsible AI practices, including appropriate guardrails and role-based access control (RBAC), to ensure secure, compliant, and trustworthy operation."
